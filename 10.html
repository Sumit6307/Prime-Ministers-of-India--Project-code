                    Atal Bihari Vajpayee was, perhaps, one of the most important political leaders of India.
                    He was the 10th Prime Minister of India; first serving a term for just 13 days before resigning
                    in
                    1996, then for period of 11 months between 1998 and 1999, and finally for full term in 1999 up
                    until
                    2004.
                    He is the only non-Congress Prime Minister to have served a full term in office.

                    Vajpayee’s tenure in politics began before India got its independence.
                    By 1942, he had become an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
                    While participating in the ‘Quit India Movement’, he was arrested along with his brother, Prem,
                    for
                    24 days.
                    He joined the Bharatiya Jan Sangh in 1951, and became its national president in 1968.

                    During the Indira Gandhi government’s emergency of 1975, Vajpayee was arrested along with
                    several
                    opposition leaders.
                    However, during the Jan Sangh’s victory in the 1977 general elections, he became the Minister of
                    External Affairs in Prime Minister Morarji Desai‘s cabinet.
                    He became the first person, as foreign minister, to deliver a speech to he United Nations
                    General
                    Assembly in Hindi.

                <section><br>&nbsp
                    However, in 1979, Morarji Desai resigned as Prime Minister leading to the dissolution of the
                    Janata
                    Sangh.
                    Vajpayee, along with many of his colleagues from the Bharatiya Jan Sangh and the Rashtriya
                    Swayamsevak Sangh came together to form the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 1980.
                    He was the party’s first president, and emerged as a strong critic of the Congress (R)
                    government
                    that followed the Janata Sangh.

                    Vajpayee was a member of the Indian Parliament for over four decades, having been elected ten
                    times
                    to the Lok Sabha, and twice to the Rajya Sabha.
                    He served as MP for Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh until 2009.
                    He suffered from a stroke in 2009 which saw the ageing leader retire from active politics.
                    Post his political career, he did not attend any public engagements and only stepped out of the
                    house for checkups at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
